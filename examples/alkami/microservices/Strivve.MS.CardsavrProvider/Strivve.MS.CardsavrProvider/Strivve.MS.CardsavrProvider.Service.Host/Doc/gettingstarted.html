				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>The provider service template creates a runnable service that includes example settings to illustrate the configurable nature of the service implementation.</p>
				<p>These settings should be changed to meet the intended purpose of this service. These setting values are located in the `insert_provider_settings.sql` script and the `ServiceImp.SettingManagement.cs` class.</p>
                
				<h2>Read about services</h2>
                <p>Make sure to read the <a target="_blank" href="https://extranet.alkamitech.com/display/SDKC/My+First+Provider+Service">My First Provider Service</a> tutorial.</p>
				<p>Make sure to read the other resources located on the right side panel of this page.</p>
                
                <h2>Build the service</h2>
                <p>Build the solution and make sure the NuGet packages are properly restored and all the projects build correctly.</p>

                <h2>Configure the service</h2>
                <p>Run the included `insert_provider_setting.sql` script to insert the service information and the accompanying settings.</p>

                <h2>Updating Packages</h2>
                <p>It's always good to stay up to date with Alkami's latest packages. Update any stale Alkami packages using the NuGet Package Manager.</p>
